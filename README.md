> Leada has four different learning tools that can be used to bridge the communication gap between people and those who have a disability related to voice, speech or language. 

### Working
- **Text-to-Speech conversion tool**: used HTML5 SpeechSynthesis API to get the machine to convert text to speech.  
- **Text-to-Braille conversion tool + Text-to-Sign Language conversion tool**: took each character in the input phrase and converted each symbol to create a phrase. 
- **Sign language learning game**: Assigned the corresponding sign language to an alphabet. Using user's input it was determined if the answer was right or wrong. The recurring loop would cycle wrong answers until the user got it right.
- **Website**: The website was created using google sites and the above codes were linked to each component. Access our site <a href= "https://sites.google.com/view/leada" target= "Leada"> here </a>
